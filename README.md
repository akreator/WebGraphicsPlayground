New passion project!  Right now the plan is to check out Three.js, but who knows what will happen?

At the summer camp I worked at, we wouldn't tell the kids our real names.  Instead, we went by "camp names" for the whole summer. 
One of our favorite things to do was come up with ridiculous stories about why our camp names were our real names.
For instance, my friend "Cheese" was raised by dairy farmers.  Her parents are named Milk and Yogurt.


I wanted to make a fun, simple site, so I thought I'd play along.  I made this site, and 
I'd leave it up in the background, sometimes, while the kids were working.
